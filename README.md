# Flappy Stacks

A money-themed Flappy Bird clone with a hard level and a shop!

## Description  
Flappy Stacks is a fun and addictive game where you control a money bag, trying to navigate through golden pipes without crashing. This game is a twist on the classic Flappy Bird, with a money theme, a challenging hard level, and a shop to upgrade your character. Built using Python and the Pygame library, it's a great example of simple yet engaging game development.

## How to Play  
- Use the **spacebar** to make the money bag flap and avoid the golden pipes.  
- The game ends when the money bag crashes into a pipe or the ground.  
- Collect coins to unlock upgrades in the shop!  
- Try the **hard level** for an extra challenge.
